/*
  SD card datalogger
 
 This example shows how to log data from three analog sensors 
 to an SD card using the SD library.
 	
 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** UNO:  MOSI - pin 11, MISO - pin 12, CLK - pin 13, CS - pin 4 (CS pin can be changed)
  and pin #10 (SS) must be an output
 ** Mega:  MOSI - pin 51, MISO - pin 50, CLK - pin 52, CS - pin 4 (CS pin can be changed)
  and pin #52 (SS) must be an output
 ** Leonardo: Connect to hardware SPI via the ICSP header
 		Pin 4 used here for consistency with other Arduino examples

// On the Ethernet Shield, CS is pin 4. Note that even if it's not
// used as the CS pin, the hardware CS pin (10 on most Arduino boards,
// 53 on the Mega) must be left as an output or the SD library
// functions will not work.

 // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);
   while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for Leonardo only
  }


  Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");
  // make sure that the default chip select pin is set to
  // output, even if you don't use it:
  pinMode(SS, OUTPUT);
  
  // see if the card is present and can be initialized:
  if (!SD.begin(chipSelect)) {
    Serial.println("Card failed, or not present");
    // don't do anything more:
    while (1) ;
  }
  Serial.println("card initialized.");
  
  // Open up the file we're going to log to!
  dataFile = SD.open("datalog.txt", FILE_WRITE);
  if (! dataFile) {
    Serial.println("error opening datalog.txt");
    // Wait forever since we cant write data
    while (1) ;
  }
}

void loop()
{
  // make a string for assembling the data to log:
  String dataString = "";

  // read three sensors and append to the string:
  for (int analogPin = 0; analogPin < 3; analogPin++) {
    int sensor = analogRead(analogPin);
    dataString += String(sensor);
    if (analogPin < 2) {
      dataString += ","; 
    }
  }

  dataFile.println(dataString);

  // print to the serial port too:
  Serial.println(dataString);
  
  // The following line will 'save' the file to the SD card after every
  // line of data - this will use more power and slow down how much data
  // you can read but it's safer! 
  // If you want to speed up the system, remove the call to flush() and it
  // will save the file only every 512 bytes - every time a sector on the 
  // SD card is filled with data.
  dataFile.flush();
  
  // Take 1 measurement every 500 milliseconds
  delay(500);
